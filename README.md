# ✈️ Dynamic Airline Pricing Optimization

This project applies stochastic optimization techniques to improve airline ticket pricing for an Online Travel Agency (OTA). It dynamically adjusts prices based on demand uncertainty and competitor strategies to maximize expected revenue across routes to Paris, London, and New York.


## Summary

Developed dynamic airline pricing models using stochastic optimization to manage demand uncertainty.  
Achieved 3.2% higher revenue and better responsiveness than deterministic models.  
Enabled strategic pricing across high-elasticity markets: Paris, London, and New York.
